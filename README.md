For my first project, I used PostgreSQL to analyze the Kaggle Dataset [Renewable Energy World Wide : 1965~2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belayethossainds/renewable-energy-world-wide-19652022). This dataset on renewable energy contains data on renewable energy usage worldwide from 1965 to 2022. My analysis emphasizes how in the last ~15 years, countries have started making a bigger effort towards using a higher amount of renewable energy in their energy mix - however, this still hasn't been enough to heal decades of abuse on our planet.
