In my second project, I simulated a business case in which a developer has to create a new app for the Android market, and wants to make sure they know the best possible conditions in order for it to be as highly rated as possible. To find what type of app would perform best, I analyzed the [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) Kaggle Dataset, using Python and its libraries Pandas, matplotlib and Seaborn. My analysis found what the most popular categories, genres and content ratings are for apps in the Google Play Store.

For my first project, I used PostgreSQL to analyze the Kaggle Dataset [Renewable Energy World Wide : 1965~2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belayethossainds/renewable-energy-world-wide-19652022). This dataset on renewable energy contains data on renewable energy usage worldwide from 1965 to 2022. My analysis emphasizes how in the last ~15 years, countries have started making a bigger effort towards using a higher amount of renewable energy in their energy mix - however, this still hasn't been enough to heal decades of abuse on our planet.
